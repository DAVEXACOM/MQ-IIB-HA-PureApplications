Issue deploying the MQ 8.0.0.4 software component on PureApplication 2.1.2.0 and higher. 
APAR 15252 has been created for this issue, and an interim fix is available (1.0.0.2-WS-MQ-Pure-LAIT15252) 
from the IBM Support Portal

APAR IT15252, PROBLEM SUMMARY :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to an interface change in IBM Pure Application System 2.1.2.0, 2.2.0.0 and
greater, installation and upgrade of IBM MQ at the latest maintenance level
contained in the pattern-type will fail. Whilst the installation will appear to
have worked, IBM MQ 8.0.0.2 will be installed and the subsequent fixpack update
will not have been applied. This affects IBM MQ Pure Application System
pattern-types 1.0.0.2 and earlier, leading to the following restrictions:

For IBM Pure Application System releases earlier than 2.1.2.0 and at version
2.1.2.1, you can install all versions of IBM MQ contained in the pattern-type.
You can also apply maintenance to running pattern instances.

For IBM Pure Application System 2.1.2.0, 2.2.0.0 and later, you can install IBM
MQ 8.0.0.2 only. You cannot install later versions e.g., 8.0.0.4. You cannot
apply maintenance to running pattern instances.
